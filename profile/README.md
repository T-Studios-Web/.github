# Welcome to T-Studio Web Development!
This is the main repo for all things related to T-Studios AEM/web components. Here you'll find all the components and applications we've built along with special properties associated with TSW designs.

## Development Process
Since our team is project-based, we have a unique way of working with the design team. At a high-level, this is how projects usually go:

• For projects that require development, we're usually brought in to start the framework for apps/components around R2 or R3 of a project. We're always part of conversations with the business/DBMs right from kickoff.

• Development time is separate from design time. We are diligent that our team has enough time built into the WBS to ensure proper development, testing, and so on.

• Our Web Ops partners will always request up to 2 weeks for publishing time. During this time, we'll work directly with Web Ops in the assigned Jira ticket to ensure proper testing and QA is occurring. If you're not assigned in the Jira ticket, you'll need to work with the DBM and/or DEL of the project to ensure you're added.

• During the time that Web Operations is working on the code, we’ll take the time to write documentation and provide guidance on how the component(s) work, the variables and functions involved with the experience, and anything considered important that needs to be communicated.

## Levels of Effort
Our team operates on T-Shirt sizing. Here's approximately which sizes are associated with which timelines:

**Small Projects:** Are typically for projects requiring small adjustments and updates. We shouldn't be doing anything to extraneous for projects like this. SLA is usually 1-2 weeks.

**Medium Projects:** Are typically for components that don't require a lot of logic. They're primarily HTML/CSS with some minor scripting. SLA is usually 2-4 weeks.

**Large Projects:** Are reserved for components with a significant amount of logic built in. The HTML/CSS may be minor compared to the amount of scripting we'll need to write. SLA is usually 4-6 weeks.

**X-Large Projects:** Are essentially SPA pages. Examples of this include Annual Reports, micro-experiences, and anything significant that spans the whole page. SLA is usually 6-8 weeks.
